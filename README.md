# Nixie Bar Graph Hat for Raspberry Pi Zero

See [www.surfncircuits.com](http://www.surfncircuits.com) for more information.  This github repository contains the Kicad Schematic, Layout, and Python Library for a PCB Hat that works with the Rasperry Pi Zero, and B+ along with the [Nixie Tube Power Supply](https://wp.me/p85ddV-Ck) designed in a previous [www.surfncircuits.com](http://www.surfncircuits.com) blog.

__KC_NixieBarGraphHat__:  Kicad schematic, PCB layout, BOM of the HAT.  The footprint is designed to mounted to the top of the Raspberry Pin zero and B+.   When the board is complete it can be orderable at __oshparkcom__.<a href=""></img></a>

__PythonRpiIN9Nixie__:  The Python Library that can control and the Nixie Bar Graph Hat.   Please see the README file in this submodule and the Blog Entry at [surfncircuits](http://www.surfncircuits.com) for details on how to install the library and how it runs.  

__Datasheeets__: Datasheets for the different components on the pCB.   Many of the datasheets are also linked directly in the Kicad schematic to the Digikey (TM) datasheet.
