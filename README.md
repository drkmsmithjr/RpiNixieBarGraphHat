# Nixie Bar Graph Hat for Raspberry Pi Zero (updated to Part 2)

See [www.surfncircuits.com](https://wp.me/p85ddV-HQ) for more information.  This github repository contains the Kicad Schematic, Layout, and Python Library for a PCB Hat that works with the Rasperry Pi Zero, and B+ along with the [Nixie Tube Power Supply](https://wp.me/p85ddV-Ck) designed in a previous [www.surfncircuits.com](https://wp.me/p85ddV-HQ) blog.

__KC_NixieBarGraphHat__:  Kicad schematic, PCB layout, BOM of the HAT.  The footprint is designed to mounted to the top of the Raspberry Pin zero and B+.   The board is orderable at <a href="https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/QQtVVeGg"><img src="https://oshpark.com/assets/badge-5b7ec47045b78aef6eb9d83b3bac6b1920de805e9a0c227658eac6e19a045b9c.png" alt="Order from OSH Park"></img></a> 

__PythonRpiIN9Nixie__:  The Python Library that can control and the Nixie Bar Graph Hat.   Please see the README file in this submodule and the Blog Entry at [surfncircuits](http://www.surfncircuits.com) for details on how to install the library and how it runs.  

__Datasheeets__: Datasheets for the different components on the pCB.   Many of the datasheets are also linked directly in the Kicad schematic to the Digikey (TM) datasheet.
